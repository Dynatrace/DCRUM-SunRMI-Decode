# Sun RMI script for DC RUM

The script enables you to monitor the method invocation timings without instrumenting the application. It refers to RMI objects and methods in the server-server or client-server communication. 
To see the readable method names on the CAS reports, you need to use the Dynatrace provided tool to create a dictionary file with the mapping between the hashcodes and the method names. See [Mapping RMI Methods to Readable Names](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/DCRUM123/Mapping+RMI+Methods+to+Readable+Names) for details. The download includes both, the Universal Decode script and a unit test.
